Everyday I read papers related to deep reinforcement learning and gaussian processes which are my interested research topics. Those gave me research inspirations and thoughts. Also I check reddit and twitter for the state-of-the-art research papers.
For the reinforcement learning, such topics including better exploration methods, continuous controls, and hierarchical learning are my tastes. I started to get interested in gaussian process by researching better exploration. Uncertainty is the key of the deep learning and largely concerning to reinforcement learning too.
The below lists are the collection of currently reading papers.
