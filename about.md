I am currently pursuing unified Master's and Doctor's degree at Kwangwoon University, majoring in Electronics and Communications Engineering. Mostly, I independently study Computer Science courses. My interests are deep learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. More descriptions of myself are followed:

- Knowledge focusing on deep neural networks including convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks, generative models, and reinforcement algorithms
- Familiarity with machine learning libraries (Scipy, Numpy) and deep learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- The ability to read and understand scientific papers on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms
- I check recent trends on deep learning from Reddit and I read research papers for breakfast
